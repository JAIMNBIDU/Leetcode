LeetCode Solutions — Structured Learning Repository

This repository documents my ongoing LeetCode practice in a clean, organized format.
The goal is not only to solve problems, but to understand why each solution works and build long-term problem-solving
intuition.

To keep everything consistent and easy to navigate, the repo is split into two simple folders:

📁 Folder Structure
leetcode/
│
├── code/
│   └── <problem_name>.py
│
└── readme/
    └── README(<problem_name>).md

1. Code/ — All Solutions

Contains the actual Python implementations for each LeetCode problem.
Each file is named after the problem for easy lookup.
Example:
code/
 ├── two_sum.py
 ├── add_two_numbers.py
 └── palindrome_number.py

2. README/ — Explanations for Every Problem

For every solution in code/, there is a corresponding explanation file in readme/.
These files break down:
Problem summary
Core idea
Approach used
Why the code works
Example:
readme/
 ├── README(two_sum).md
 ├── README(add_two_numbers).md
 └── README(palindrome_number).md
```
### Purpose of This Repository
```
This repo serves as a documentation-first learning log, where every solution is paired with a clear explanation.
The focus is on learning patterns, understanding tradeoffs, and refining problem-solving fundamentals.
It helps me:
Track progress
Build strong explanations (useful for interviews)
Maintain clean, readable code
Revisit concepts easily over time
```
### How This Repo Will Grow
```
I will keep adding:
New LeetCode solutions in the code/ folder
Matching explanation files in the readme/ folder
Optional category-based organization later (arrays, linked lists, math, DP, etc.)
The goal is consistency over time, not uploading hundreds of problems blindly.
